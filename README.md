This repository demonstrates a subtle but common error in Ruby: inadvertently creating a read-only attribute when intending to create a read-write attribute. The `bug.rb` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.rb` provides the corrected version.  Understanding the difference between getters and setters in Ruby is crucial for avoiding this type of bug.
